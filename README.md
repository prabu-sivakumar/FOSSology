## Why we need to look at licenses?
So what is Open Source Software (OSS)?

 - Made available with source code
 - Providing the right to study, modify and redistribute, etc., 

## Open Source Initiative (OSI)

 - Free Redistribution

## What is Open Source Software License?

### Basics about Licensing

 - Obligations
 - Restrictions
 - Rights

### Example for GPL version 2.0

 - Obligations
	 - Include original source code, copyrights
	 - Include license
 - Restrictions
	 - Cannot be held liable

## Open Source Software License Categories
 
 - Permissive 
	 - allow **you to copy, modify, recombine, and redistribute the work with minimal restrictions**
 - Copy left (reciprocal licenses or restrictive licenses)
	 - provides the same permission as the permissive license, but **requires you to release any derivate works** made under the same copyleft license. 
	 - GNU GPL (General Public License 2.0) is one of the most common restrictive license. 

# Goals
